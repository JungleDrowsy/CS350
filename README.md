Thermostat Project
Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
This project aimed to integrate various built-in board peripherals to simulate a working thermostat. By responding to temperature changes with an LED indicator and adjusting values, it mimicked the functionality of a heater, combining theoretical knowledge with practical application.

What did you do particularly well?
The structured approach to the code and the logical naming of variables were my strong points. The code's readability, aided by comprehensive comments and a logical flow, made the project's purpose and functionality clear and accessible.

Where could you improve?
My tendency to overthink solutions led to multiple rewrites of the program. I also see a need to enhance my understanding of programming the board's peripherals more efficiently.

What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
Engaging in project discussions proved highly beneficial, not only in clarifying aspects of the project but also in highlighting the importance of collaborative problem-solving. Delving into the header files for the drivers used in the project was also enlightening.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
This project significantly improved my ability to code peripherals to work together seamlessly, a skill set that promises to be highly transferable to a wide range of future projects.

How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I prioritized maintaining clean, well-commented code to facilitate understanding and future modifications. The project's structure is designed to be easily adjustable, allowing for straightforward alterations or expansions as needed.
